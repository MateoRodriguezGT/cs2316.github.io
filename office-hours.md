# Office Hours

## Professor Simpkins's Office Hours, CoC 133 or on of my TA labs -- CoC 107 and 107A.

- Tuesdays, 13:15 - 15:15
- Fridays, 17:15 - 18:15

Any time my office door is open, feel free to walk in. Email me if you need to see me, even during office hours since I won't necessarily be in my office or the TA lab if I'm not expecting anyone.
