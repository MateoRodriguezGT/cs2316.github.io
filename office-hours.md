# Office Hours

## Professor, CoC 133

Thursdays 12:00-15:00, other times by appointment. If I'm not in my office I'll be in 107A or 107.

Any time my door is propped open, feel free to stop in (if the door is closed I'm either not in or need privacy). If you'd like to see me outside of the hours listed above, please feel free to send me an email.

## TA Lab, CoC 107A
