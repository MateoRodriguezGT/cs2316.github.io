# Homework 3 - French Verbs

## Introduction

In this homework you will practice processing CSV, XML, and JSON data.

## General Instructions

**This is an individual assignment.**

Collaboration at a reasonable level will not result in substantially similar code. Students may only collaborate with fellow students currently taking Intro to Computing, the TA's and the lecturer. Collaboration means talking through problems, assisting with debugging, explaining a concept, etc. You should not exchange code or write code for others.

Notes:

- Include a comment with your name and GTID at the top of all Python files.
- *Do not wait until the last minute* to do this assignment in case you run into problems.
- Pay close attention to whether problems require you to print or return the results! Printing instead of returning or vice versa will result in a point deduction.
- Name all functions as specified in the instructions.
- Unless otherwise stated, you can assume inputs will be valid in this assignment (i.e. error checking is not required).
- In a Python module you must define a value (such as a function) before referencing it. So if you call function A from function B, the definition of function A must come before the definition of function B in the file.

## Problem Descrtiption

You are creating a web service that will provide data on french verbs -- given a french verb you will provide its conjugations and some example sentences. Your source data are partly in XML and partly in CSV files, but you want to provide data to clients in JSON format, as is common in web services.

## Solution Description

As a first step you decide to simply write a Python program to consolidate your XML and CSV data and produce JSON files that will be privided by your french verb service.

[conjugations-0-2-0.csv](conjugations-0-2-0.csv)



## Submission Instructions

Attach your `verb-consolidator.py` file to your T-Square HW2 assignment submission.

## Verify Your T-Square Submission!

Practice safe submission! Verify that your HW files were truly submitted correctly, the upload was successful, and that your program runs with no syntax or runtime errors. It is solely your responsibility to turn in your homework and practice this safe submission safeguard.

- After uploading the files to T-Square you should receive an email from T-Square listing the names of the files that were uploaded and received. If you do not get the confirmation email almost immediately, something is wrong with your HW submission and/or your email. Even receiving the email does not guarantee that you turned in exactly what you intended.
- After submitting the files to T-Square, return to the Assignment menu option and this homework. It should show the submitted files.
- Download copies of your submitted files from the T-Square Assignment page placing them in a new folder.
- Re-run and test the files you downloaded from T-Square to make sure it's what you expect.
- This procedure helps guard against a few things.

    - It helps insure that you turn in the correct files.
    - It helps you realize if you omit a file or files. Missing files will not be given any credit, and non-compiling homework solutions will receive few to zero points. Also recall that late homework will not be accepted regardless of excuse. Treat the due date with respect.  Do not wait until the last minute! (If you do discover that you omitted a file, submit all of your files again, not just the missing one.)
    - Helps find syntax errors or runtime errors that you may have added after you last tested your code.
