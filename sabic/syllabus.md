# Introduction to Computing with Python

## Instructor

* Christopher Simpkins, simpkins@cc.gatech.edu

## Course Description

This course introduces computing and programming in the Python programming language.

## Learning Outcomes

Student in the class will achieve the following learning objectives:

(Competency) Students will be able to:

1. Write programs using various data types, and using basic techniques such as assignment, method calls, while loops, for loops, and conditionals.
2. Use and manipulate several language provided data structures such as: Lists, Dictionaries, and Strings.
3. Read and write data to and from text files, both as plain text and in structured formats (such as CSV).
4. Read a textual representation of numerical data and convert it to the appropriate (integer/floating point) data type.
averaging a row of data, calculating standard deviation) into a program.
5. Use compound data structures provided by the programming language such as lists, arrays, and dictionaries to hold sequences or sets of data, including two-dimensional (tabular) data.
6. Use objects and associated methods provided by the programming language.
7. Write programs that are easy to understand so that others may modify and improve them.

(Movement) Students will increase their:

1. Familiarity with compound data structures (lists, arrays, dictionaries), including nested data structures (multi-dimensional arrays, etc...) and indexing into multi-dimensional data structures.
2. Speed and accuracy in converting problem statements into programs.
3. Understanding of and ability to quickly use basic program structures such as iteration, conditionals, and function calls due to repeated practice of these concepts.
4. Ability to break a medium sized problem down into smaller parts and solve each sub-problem individually.
5. Ability to test and debug programs.

(Experience) Students will:

1. Practice the process of constructing small (10 - 100 line) programs from written requirements.

## Requirements

### Grading

* Homework: 50%
* Quizes: 50%

Grade Cutoffs: A: 90, B: 80, C: 70, D: 60

### Assignments

One quiz and programming assignment per week.

#### Class Participation

Various classes and recitations will have small assignments due in class. These may be submitted via paper, T-Square, GT GitHub, USB thub drive, or PRS (clicker) devices. In-class exercises cannot be "made-up" if you do not attend the class. It’s a violation of the Academic Honor Code to submit work or "sign-in" for other students.

#### Academic Integrity and Collaboration

We expect academic honor and integrity from students. Please study and follow the academic honor code of Georgia Tech: http://www.honor.gatech.edu/content/2/the-honor-code. You may collaborate on homework assignments, but your submissions must be your own. You may not collaborate on in-class programming quizzes or exams.

#### Due Dates, Late Work, and Missed Work

* Homework assignments are due by 23:55 on the assignment's due date. Multiple resubmissions are allowed, so submit early and often so you aren't in a rush on the due date. Late submissions receive a 0.

#### Grade contest

To contest any grade you must submit an official regrade form **within one week of the assignment's original return date**. The original return date is the date the exam was first made available for students to pick up or the grade was posted online in the case of homework assignments and programming quizzes.
