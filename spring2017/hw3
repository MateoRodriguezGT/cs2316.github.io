# Homework 3 - Pet Store

## Introduction

In this homework you will practice

- csv reading
- class dunder functions
- using instance variables
- class specific funtions
- writing a main function

## General Instructions

**This is an individual assignment.**

Collaboration at a reasonable level will not result in substantially similar code. Students may only collaborate with fellow students currently taking CS 2316, the TAs and the lecturer. Collaboration means talking through problems, assisting with debugging, explaining a concept, etc. You should not exchange code or write code for others.

Notes:

- Include a comment with your name and GTID at the top of all Python files.
- *Do not wait until the last minute* to do this assignment in case you run into problems.
- Pay close attention to whether problems require you to print or return the results! Printing instead of returning or vice versa will result in a point deduction.
- Name all functions as specified in the instructions.
- Unless otherwise stated, you can assume inputs will be valid in this assignment (i.e. error checking is not required).
- In a Python module you must define a value (such as a function) before referencing it. So if you call function A from function B, the definition of function A must come before the definition of function B in the file.
