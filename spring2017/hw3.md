# Homework 3 - Pet Store

## Introduction

In this homework you will practice

- csv reading
- class dunder functions
- using instance variables
- class specific funtions
- writing a main function

## General Instructions

**This is an individual assignment.**

Collaboration at a reasonable level will not result in substantially similar code. Students may only collaborate with fellow students currently taking CS 2316, the TAs and the lecturer. Collaboration means talking through problems, assisting with debugging, explaining a concept, etc. You should not exchange code or write code for others.

Notes:

- Include a comment with your name and GTID at the top of all Python files.
- *Do not wait until the last minute* to do this assignment in case you run into problems.
- Pay close attention to whether problems require you to print or return the results! Printing instead of returning or vice versa will result in a point deduction.
- Name all functions as specified in the instructions.
- Unless otherwise stated, you can assume inputs will be valid in this assignment (i.e. error checking is not required).
- In a Python module you must define a value (such as a function) before referencing it. So if you call function A from function B, the definition of function A must come before the definition of function B in the file.

## Problem Description

You have decided to open a Pet Store!  However you quickly realize that in order to have a well run pet store you are going to need some sort of inventory system to keep track of all the pets you have for sale and how much money the pet store has. You will create a Pet class that defines the properties of a Pet, then create a Pet Store class that will manage an inventory of Pet objects.  You will also need to be able 

In this homework you will be writing 2 classes, a method to read in data from a csv file, and a main method to call all of the methods that you write.
