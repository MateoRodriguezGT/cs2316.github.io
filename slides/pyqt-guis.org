* PyQt GUIs

** Python GUIs

- Python wasn't originally desined for GUI programming
- In the interest of "including batteries" the ~tkinter~ was included in the Python standard library

    - ~tkinter~ is a Python wrapper around the Tcl/Tk GUI toolkit
    - Tk must be installed on your system (included in most Unixes, additional install on Mac and Windows)
    - Tk is old and weak

- Many other GUI libraries were created for Python. wxPython, PyGTK, and PyQt/PySide the most popular

- PyQt/PySide was once difficult to install because Qt was difficult to install, but the Anaconda folks fixed that.

- So we'll use PyQt, PyQt4 to be precise.

** PyQt

- Qt is a C++ library originally created by Norwegian company Troll Tech.

- Qt has always enjoyed a reputation as a well-designed and powerful GUI framework.

- The KDE project chose to base their popular KDE (K Desktop Environment) graphical shell for Linux.

- Like most modern GUI frameworks, Qt (and PyQt) makes heavy use of objects.

** Hello, PyQt

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import sys
from PyQt4 import QtGui

app = QtGui.QApplication(sys.argv)

w = QtGui.QWidget()
w.setWindowTitle('Hello PyQt!')
w.show()
sys.exit(app.exec_())
#+END_SRC

Online: [[../code/gui/helloqt.py][helloqt.py]]

** Basic PyQt App Outline

1. Create a ~QApplication~ object
2. Create a main application window (~QWidget~ object)
3. Set paramters of the main window, create and add child widgets, etc.
4. Show main application window
5. Start the app (~app.exec_()~)
